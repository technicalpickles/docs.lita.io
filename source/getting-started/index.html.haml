        %h2 Overview

      %p <strong>Lita</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatterbot">chat bot</a> written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> with persistent storage provided by <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>. It uses a plugin system to connect to different chat services and to provide new behavior. The plugin system uses the familiar tools of the Ruby ecosystem: <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> and <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>.

      %p Lita draws much inspiration from GitHub's fantastic <a href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>, but has a few key differences and strengths:

      %ul
        %li It's written in Ruby.
        %li It exposes the full power of Redis rather than using it to serialize JSON.
        %li It's easy to develop and test plugins for with the provied <a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec">RSpec</a> extras. Lita strongly encourages thorough testing of plugins.
        %li It uses the Ruby ecosystem's standard tools (RubyGems and Bundler) for plugin installation and loading.
